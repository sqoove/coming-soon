## Newsletter Integration

The template includes a sample newsletter form:

```html
<form action="#">
  <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
  <button type="submit">Notify Me</button>
</form>
```

To make it functional:

* Connect to your preferred service (e.g., Mailchimp, Sendinblue, Formspree).
* Update the `action` attribute with your form endpoint.

* * *

## Customization Tips

* Change the background image URL in the `<section class="main">` inline style.
* Adjust typography, colors, and spacing in `main.css`.
* Add animation effects or countdown scripts if desired.

* * *

## Dependencies

* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) – responsive grid and UI components
* Custom CSS (`assets/css/main.css`)

*(No JavaScript dependency by default — fully functional with pure HTML/CSS.)*
